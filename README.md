## General Info
This project was built to visualize physical phenomena using animations and GUI, written in Python using custom modules and Tkinter. With this physics simulator, you’re able to change what you want to change--mass, height, or velocity--depending on which scenario you pick. And you’ll be able to see relevant graphs from the given simulation. Experiment with the different parameters.
